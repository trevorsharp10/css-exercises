# Class and ID Selectors

* **All odd numbered elements**: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing `Verdana` and `DejaVu Sans` with `sans-serif` as a fallback
* **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px
* **The third element**: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
* **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Do the odd numbered `p` elements share a class?
- Do the even numbered `div` elements have unique IDs?
- Does the Number 3 element have multiple classes?
