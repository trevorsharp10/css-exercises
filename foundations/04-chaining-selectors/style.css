/* Add CSS Styling */


.avatar.proportioned {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100%;
}

.avatar.distorted {
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
}

/* The properties you need to add to each element are:

* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `proportioned` classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted` classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Did you properly chain class selectors for each rule?
- Does the `proportioned` image retain its original square proportions?
- Does the `distorted` image end up looking squished and, well, distorted?
